# frogmouth keyboard firmware

This is the firmware for my keyboards.

## Key layout

The alpha layout I use is an idiosyncratic modification of RSTHD. It's described in the [Kyria readme](./kyria-rsthd-prime/README.md).

There you will also find my other layers. Sometimes I think there is too much emphasis on the alpha key layout in the various forums and discord servers - the larger part of the battle is the other layers and thumb keys!

## Custom features

While I use QMK, I've also added a fair of custom code to make things work exactly the way I want it to. In some cases, since I spent a couple of years trying to squeeze the firmware into a Pro Micro, this also saved "a lot" of firmware space.

Arguably, QMK now includes some of the things I've added. Still, you may find some things of interest here in the [common code directory](./common/).

## Keyboards

I started with a Kyria, which is a brilliant design, and almost perfect (for a flat board). I've tried other boards but so far none have stuck. The Kyria directory still has most of the documentation.

- [Kyria rev1 and rev3](./kyria-rsthd-prime/)
- [Cherry Corne](./cherry-corne/) (no longer used or maintained)
- Dactyl manuformish 4x6 (coming "soon"!)
