# Kyria RSTHD/Prime

**Under development.** This is a keymap I'm working on for my Kyria keyboard from [splitkb.com](https://splitkb.com). The alpha layout was based on [RSTHD](https://xsznix.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/introducing-the-rsthd-layout/) but is now heavily modified. For a standard implementation of RSTHD on the Kyria, see my [Kyria Refactored](https://github.com/frogm0uth/keyboard-firmware/tree/master/kyria-refactored) keymap.

## Overview

***This is under development.***

The alphabetic layout in this keymap was originally based on [RSTHD](https://xsznix.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/introducing-the-rsthd-layout/). I tried it, liked it, tweaked it, and tweaked some more. For better or worse, this is the result...

When I originally started making changes to RSTHD, I called it RSTHD'. The `'`, pronounced "prime", is [used in maths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)#Use_in_mathematics,_statistics,_and_science) to indicate a derivative of the named thing. The layout still very much retains its RSTHD DNA despite all the changes. I figure calling it *RSTHD/Prime* acknowledges its origin while still indicating that it's different.

### Keyboard configuration

My Kyria uses all 6 columns on each hand, four thumb keys on each hand, one encoder on each hand. The top two thumb keys on each side are not on the board.

Controller is Pro Micro, so this keymap only just squeezes in.

### Goals

Coming from a "slab" QWERTY keyboard to a programmable ergo split, I wanted to optimize:

- Cross-platform portability. I need to switch between macOS and Windows frequently. The differences in shortcuts and location of Ctrl/Cmd keys was frustrating and programmable keyboards seemed to be the answer.
- Comfort. For me, that largely means de-emphasizing the inner index columns.
- Better support for ambidextrous use of the trackpad or mouses (I use two). That is, it should be possible to do things like cut-copy-paste from either hand alone.

Typing speed and reducing the number of keys on the keyboard are not important goals to me.

### QMK notes

Features of QMK that I've used:

- Layers
- Mod-taps
- Custom code ("macros")

Features that I haven't used:

- One-shots
- Tap dance

I did use combos extensively but the QMK version has been replaced by my userspace version, comborolls.

## Features
The code is written so that most features can be turned on and off in rules.mk and it will still compile. The default settings leave almost no space in the Pro Micro, so turning anything on will require that something else be turned off.

### Platform-dependent shortcuts

Some layers have a modifier called CmdCtl. This acts as Cmd (aka Gui) in macOS and Ctrl in Windows and Linux. A number of shortcuts in applications morph this way between platforms.

However, there are big differences still. To avoid confusion when switching platforms, the keyboard can be switched between shortcuts for each platform at run-time. See os_shortcuts.h/c and os_shortcut_defs.h.

### Comborolls

This is my userspace implementation/variant of combos triggered by rolling keys rather than keys pressed at the same time. Since I started on this, QMK [acquired](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/15083) the COMBO_MUST_PRESS_IN_ORDER flag, which AFAIK does the same thing. However I've kept my version for now as it uses less space and the Pro Micro is *very* tight on space.

Comborolls are defined with the aid of a set of macros, see `combo_defs.h`. 
Although the order of keys matters, you can use the macros to define combos that trigger in either direction, for use with vertical pairs or even thumb keys. 

Comborolls are used to:
- Remove SFUs e.g. SC, TW and other awkward sequences e.g. CR, PR, MY, MIN.
- Remove reversals aka "pinballing". Combos for ER, ES, and ED on the right hand convert many of the reversals on the left hand into a simple hand swap.
- Make common words or word endings easier: YOU, VERY, IGHT, OULD, OUGH.
- Reduce inner column usage further: B: BR,  BE,  BLE,  BUT,  BY.

## Layers

There are a total of 6 layers. The first is the main alpha layer.

The other layers are activated with a thumb key. All are hold-to-activate &ndash; that is, no toggles or one-shots. Layer activation is done with custom code - see `layer-tap-toggle.h/c`.

### ALPHA

[KLE link](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/69cf0f771159d920a34d882d696af6aa)

The alpha layout aims to reduce lateral finger movement on the index finger. It performs very well in an analyzer, with low SFU (same finger utilization) stats and low travel distance.

### SYMS

Activated by the left thumb (hold).

[KLE link](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/0b079c6153a029c55cc8b5b7fbe701f2)

Unshifted, this layer contains most of the punctuation keys. I've arranged them so that many common (in programming) two-letter sequences can be typed with an inward roll: `{% %} <% %> </ /> <? ?> <! => -> ~/`. Since most are on the right hand, they become an easy three-key roll with Space and Enter. 

Semicolon is, surprisingly enough, not in this layer: instead there is a combo for `);`.

The ten digits are accessed with Shift, akin to [Programmer Dvorak](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/), arranged in a 3x3 numpad-like grid. However the most frequent `0 1 2` can also be accessed as a single chord with no shift on the left hand.

### EDIT

Activated by the right thumb (hold).

[KLE link](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/24a80f5840733d6384fd21e20e1f28a0)

This is an editing layer that extends the idea of platform-independent shortcuts to the whole editing layer. The navigation keys on the left have the standard four cursor keys, word left/right, and page up/down. The lower row contains keys for undo/redo and browser back/forward. The inner and pinky columns contain window/desktop manipulation keys.

On the right hand there are various special modifier keys on the right home row to speed up editing. These will be documented one day... Select all, cut, copy and paste are chorded on the  top row, and keys to switch applications, windows and tabs on the inner column.

### SNAP

Activated by the left thumb (hold).

[KLE link](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/6aa3ef0fcb5c886dc105a94b62690fe0)

So called because of the keys for window snapping. (For macOS, these require that [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com) is installed.)

There are also keys for mouse movement using some custom code. To be honest, it doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. Needs more work.

### FUNC
Activated by a combo on the left thumb (hold).

This layer contains function keys on the right hand, arranged roughly the same as the numpad. It also contains the keys that switch between macOS, Windows and Linux shortcuts.

### META
Activated by the right thumb (hold).

This layer contains common shortcut keys. They are mostly arranged according to the letter used in the Mac/Windows shortcut. For example, the S key invokes Save (Cmd-S on Mac, Ctrl-S on Windows). However, the mapping is not always that straightforward (e.g. Cmd-Q on Mac and Alt-F4 on Windows), hence the need for a dedicated layer.
