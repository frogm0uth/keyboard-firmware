Old stuff, failed experiments, etc

[Eager mod-taps](eager-modtaps.md) 

> This is a *thought experiment* and proof-of-concept implementation of a different mode of operation for mod-taps. I use the word "eager" to mean that mod-tap keys output their tap code as soon as possible. Activating the modifier requires a deliberate pause. The proof-of-concept code works, but still doesn't make home-row mods usable for me.

[Eager mod-taps, old long version](eager-modtaps-long.md) 

> This is the older and longer version of the eager mod-taps note. Possibly of interest is a bunch of textual scenarios that describe QMK's *actual* behavior for mod-taps.

[Compose key](compose-key.md)

> A [Compose key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compose_key) prefixes a sequence of keys that produce something completely different. This implementation works, but in the end I didn't find it all that useful.

[Custom mouse](custom-mouse.md)

> Custom Mouse is an *experiment* in an alternate set of mouse keys with better control. Turns out I didn't find having mouse movements key on the keyboard all that useful. Maybe at a later time.
