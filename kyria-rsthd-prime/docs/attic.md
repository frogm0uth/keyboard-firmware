> This is a *thought experiment* and proof-of-concept implementation of a different mode of operation for mod-taps. I use the word "eager" to mean that mod-tap keys output their tap code as soon as possible. Activating the modifier requires a deliberate pause. The proof-of-concept code works, but still doesn't make home-row mods usable for me.

[Eager mod-taps, old long version](eager_modtaps_long.md) 

> This is the older and longer version of the eager mod-taps note. Possibly of interest is a bunch of textual scenarios that describe QMK's *actual* behavior for mod-taps.
