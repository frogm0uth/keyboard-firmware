# Kyria RSTHD/Prime v42e - E on Left Thumb

This is the keymap with the space on the E on the left thumb, as in the original
[RSTHD](https://xsznix.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/introducing-the-rsthd-layout/). For the swapped version with E on the right thumb, see the [main doc](../README.md#alpha-layer).

## Alpha layer

![kyria-rsthd-prime-alpha](images/e-on-left-thumb/kyria-rsthd-prime-alpha.png)

[KLE link](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/9e80a5b7b1ef1f90591d57a24af558ef)

The alpha layout aims to reduce lateral finger movement on the index finger. In fact, the lower keys of the inner columns have been removed entirely.

An older version of the layout performed very well in an [analyzer](docs/prime-on-the-analyzer.md), with low SFU (same finger utilization) stats and low travel distance. Since then, some changes have been made to the layout that nominally give it worse performance, because of the use of [comborolls](#comboroll-what).

*Use of this layout **requires** comborolls.*

These letters can only be accessed with comborolls: J, K and \\. These letters are usually accessed with comborolls even though they have a key: B and V. The letter M has a comboroll on the left hand to counter pin-balling off the MNL column.

The shift keys are "auto-off":
- If a shift key is held and another key is pressed, you get the shifted version of the key then shift is turned off. This completely eliminates typos like "THe".
- If a shift key is tapped, it toggles caps-word.
- If both shift keys are tapped at the same, they toggle caps-lock.

Except for Shift, there are no modifiers on the alpha layer. To access them, hold the SYMS or EDIT layer key, hold the modifier(s) down, then release the layer key. This is a bit like Callum mods except it doesn't use one-shots.

The "repeat" thumb key is different to other implementations, in that you press it *before* the key that is to be repeated. This makes it possible to place it on the same thumb as space, as double letters often occur at the end of words.

The left encoder is used for application switching, while the right encoder scrolls up and down a page.

## Other layers

There are five more layers, for a total of 6. All are hold-to-activate. The shift keys in these layers are *not* auto-off and don't toggle caps-lock and caps-word.


### SYMS

Activated by the left thumb.

Numbers and punctuation are combined on one layer. Numbers are along the home row and punctuation is mostly arranged on the right hand. (If only one character shown, it is output regardless of Shift.)

The punctuation is arranged so that common (for me) symbol bigrams are an inward roll: `{% %} </ /> ~/ -> ()`. The `=` symbol is on the left hand because it combines with so many other symbols. Additional bigrams such as `/* */ => );` are on comborolls that activate if shift is held. Overall, this layer works much better for me than pre-v38 versions that used a numpad layout.

Cut, copy and paste shortcuts are along the left hand top row.

The encoder (right) is used to move through search results.

### EDIT

Activated by the right thumb.

![kyria-rsthd-prime-alpha](images/e-on-left-thumb/kyria-rsthd-prime-edit.png)

[KLE link](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/49ddfbdb6321d28ff68672c4d3e53381)

This layer extends the idea of platform-independent shortcuts to a complete layer. The left hand has the standard cursor keys, home/end and page up/down.

Modifiers are on the right hand. If one of the standard modifiers (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Gui) is held, the emitted code is that modifier + keycode. The special modifiers on the home row act as follows:

- **Delete** makes the action delete instead of moving.
- **More** makes the key do "more" : left and right move a word left or right; home and end move to the start and end of a paragraph; page up/down move to the start and end of the document. Up and down are an exception: these activate mouse wheel scrolling.
- **X4** makes the action repeat 4 times on every keypress or repeat.
- **Fast** removes the initial repeat delay and repeats at a faster interval.

All actions have auto-repeat. You can change the special modifiers while holding down a navigation key and the action changes accordingly.

Cut, copy and paste shortcuts are along the right hand top row. Shortcuts for window and desktop navigation are scattered around the edges.

The encoder (left) is used for history scrubbing, unless one of the edit modifier keys are held, in which case it does "fast editing." 

### META

Activated by either pinky.

![kyria-rsthd-prime-alpha](images/e-on-left-thumb/kyria-rsthd-prime-meta.png)

[KLE link](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/178af982b14b405bfbffa24283cc989c)

This layer contains common shortcuts, mostly arranged according to the letter used in the Mac/Windows shortcut. For example, the S key invokes Save (Cmd-S on Mac, Ctrl-S on Windows). However, the mapping is not always that straightforward (e.g. Cmd-Q on Mac and Alt-F4 on Windows), hence the use of a dedicated layer.

This layer also contains media control keys and the keys to access the FUNC and SNAP layers.

The encoders are used for volume (right) and screen brightness (left) control.

### FUNC

Activated by the left thumb from the META layer.

![kyria-rsthd-prime-alpha](images/e-on-left-thumb/kyria-rsthd-prime-func.png)

[KLE link](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/dbc601db377614466c20c3a079505065)

This layer contains function keys on the right hand. It also contains the keys that switch between macOS, Windows and Linux shortcuts.

The encoder (left) moves between tabs of an application. If a modifier is held, it adjusts the OLED brightness and the backlight/per-key LEDs, depending on the modifier. There are also two keys on the left hand for this, in case there is no encoder.

### SNAP

Activated by the right thumb from the META layer.

![kyria-rsthd-prime-alpha](images/e-on-left-thumb/kyria-rsthd-prime-snap.png)

[KLE link](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/d5dab9bebd902733bbd63424b1f4fa04)

So called because of the keys for window snapping, which snap the active window to various locations on the screen. This works on macOS if [Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com) is running; it is not working at all on Windows and Linux yet.

It also contains shortcuts for screenshots, to make a window full-screen and to move a window to a different screen.

The encoder (left) zooms the current application window.
